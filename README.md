- Sum of List Elements Using a while Loop in Python
  
# Description
This Python program demonstrates how to display each element of a list and calculate the total sum of its elements using a while loop.  

# What the Program Does

- Initializes a variable sum to 0.

- Initializes an index variable i to 0.

- Uses a while loop to iterate through each element of the list using the index i.

- Prints each element in the list.

- Adds the current element to the sum.

- Increments the index i.

- After the loop, prints the total sum of the elements.

# Concepts Used

- while loop

- List indexing

- len() function

- String formatting using .format()
